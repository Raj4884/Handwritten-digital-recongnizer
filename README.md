# Handwritten Digit Recognizer using CNN

This project demonstrates how to build and train a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to recognize handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset**. It's an excellent starting point for beginners in deep learning, computer vision, and neural networks.

## üîç Overview

The MNIST dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0‚Äì9), each of size 28x28 pixels. The goal is to classify each image into one of the 10 digit classes.

We use:
- **Keras** with **TensorFlow backend**
- A simple **CNN architecture**
- Standard data preprocessing techniques
- Model evaluation and visualization
